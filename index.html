                <h2>Game Overview</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    You spawn into a dense forest with no memory of how you got there. You are severely injured but alive. 
                    It is up to you to survive by foraging resources and crafting tools to thrive in your new environment. 
                    As you adventure you notice strange monolithic structures with unfamiliar language. You uncover strange 
                    dungeons and creatures that are completely unfamiliar to you unlike the surface which gives you a slight
                    sense of Déjà vu. As you continue building your base, you meet people like you who you can recruit to 
                    join your mission to uncover the truth.

                <p class="description">
                    This game is for people who want to experience a true survival experience without the unrealistic building 
                    mechanics. This game involves time-consuming harvesting and building similar to how real-life survival would 
                    work. This game is also for people who like VR games.

                <h2>Unique Selling Points</h2>
                <p class="description">>
                    my game is one of very few that provides an immersive realistic survival experience that replicates survival 
                    in real life. My game is also one of the only survival games that has been built around VR so that the experience 
                    is as immersive as possible
