                    Today I used inkscape to create vector icons for a couple of differant
                    things.<br><br>
                    I want this game to not include tons of icons and text that a few rpgs 
                    and other games have because that kinda breaks the immersion. This isnt
                    nessesarily a bad thing for all games and games like runescape or world
                    of warcraft benfit from lots of information because of how complicated 
                    the game is. however for my game, I wanted to creat an immersive survival
                    experiance, to achieve this I am going to try to have very few text and icons
                    and have optional icons and text toggleable in settings. There are going 
                    to be a few inevitable things that Im going to need to make icons for such 
                    as health so that is what I focused on today.

                    <p>I also coded a little feature that detects keypresses and displays them in 
                        the bottom right of the screen; Many differant software do this and I though
                        it looked kinda cool. Im probably going to add it as an optional setting.

                        I have learned quite a bit about instantiating in godot over the span of creating
                        this game and this allowed me to use this (in my opinon) intuitive way of adding
                        the icosn to a grid container. First I created a template scene that I could instantite
                        and when a button is presses ingame a function is called with the key image being 
                        passed into it. the function instantiates the template scene, sets its image to
                        the passed variable scene and adds it as a child of the grid-container which sorts
                        out the positioning. in the template script it simply kills itself after half a seccond
