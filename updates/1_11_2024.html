                    This is small, mainly backend update but It was nessesary to having an enjoyable gaming experiance.
                    I wrote my own way of detecting what the player was looking at by having a collision box at the 
                    players eye, then detecting objects entering and setting variables depending on differance classes.
                    The way I have written it means that it is super easy to access any information about the item from
                    anywhere in the game which will increase worflow productivity

                        I noticed that it was difficult to tell when an item was selected so I added a simple outline that appears when an item is selected.
                        This is done with a duplicated mesh of the object with a shader that makes it slighly bigger and only display the inside faces, giving
                        it and outline effect

                        I also reworked how the place outline worked. Previously it was a green cube which just broke the immersion for me personally and felt too 
                        generic. lots of game with building mechanics have a green ugly outline to indicate where you were placing the item. to fix this, I had the idea
                        of creating a glitchy outline which ties into the lore of the game (coming in alpha pre release V3). This felt and looked really cool as well as
                        being differant from lots of other games.
